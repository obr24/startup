# RecipeBook

[My Notes](notes.md)

This web application gives a place where users can share recipes. Users also have the ability to like different recipes. Users can create an account to submit different recipes with a title and a URL to the recipe. An inspiration page is also included where users can view quotes from famous people.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - A clear elevator pitch is included that explains the purpose of this web-app
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references. - An image was included that shows the basic design of the project.

### Elevator pitch

Are you getting bored of the same old recipes? Want to impress someone with your cooking skills, but don't know what to make? Enter RecipeBook, where you can view recipes shared by other cooks and bakers like yourself. Not sure if you will like a recipe? To get an idea of how good a recipe is you can see the number of likes other users have given other recipes in a list of all the recipes that have been submitted.

### Design

Here is the design of the frontend and the pages of the website.

### Key features

- User creation and login
- Submit recipe with title and URL
- View list of submitted recipes and number of likes
- Inspiration page with quote of the day

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use HTML to structure the pages of the application. There will be four HTML pages: one for login, one for new recipes, one for viewing recipes, and one for the quote of the day.
- **CSS** - Styling that is functional and nice looking. Should add to the usability of the app on all screensizes.
- **React** - Allows for login, recipe submission, viewing recipes.
- **Service** - Backend service will include endpoints for login, submision of recipes, retrieving recipes and retrieving quote of the day.
- **DB/Login** - Stores user information; recipe title, url and submitter. Liking a recipe requires authentication.
- **WebSocket** - Likes of recipes are updated in realtime on the view recipes page.
